# Utah Prostate Cancer Run - Layout Reference

## Hero Section (Image Slider)
- The hero section at the top of the page is a full-width image slider.
- It contains only images and navigation dots (no text or buttons overlay the images).
- The slider auto-scrolls and allows manual navigation via dots.
- The hero section is visually prominent and sits above the main content card.

## Main Event Card Section
- Immediately below the hero slider is a white, rounded-corner card (the "main event card").
- This card contains:
  - The event title and location (e.g., "Utah Prostate Cancer Run\nSalt Lake City")
  - Event date and city
  - Event stats (distance, air temp, airport)
  - The main register button
- The card is centered, has a shadow, and slightly overlaps the bottom of the hero slider for a "tucked under" effect.
- All event info is in this card, not over the hero image.

## Rationale
- This layout matches the style of https://www.runrocknroll.com/san-diego, where the hero image is clean and the main event info is in a card below.
- Use this document as a reference for future updates to maintain this structure.
